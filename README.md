# Creating a "Connect Wallet" Button Using ethers.js v6 in a React DApp

Welcome to the repository for the project discussed in the accompanying Medium article, "Creating a 'Connect Wallet' Button Using ethers.js v6 in a React DApp." In this article, we walk you through the process of setting up a simple decentralized application (DApp) that connects to a user's Ethereum wallet and displays their wallet address using React and ethers.js v6.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a basic DApp with the following features:

- A "Connect Wallet" button that connects to a user's Ethereum wallet.
- Display of the connected wallet address.
- Simple CSS styling for a beautiful button and user interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps outlined in the article. Here's a brief summary:

1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Set up a React app using Create React App.
3. Clean up the project by removing unnecessary files and code.
4. Create a UI with a "Connect Wallet" button and address display.
5. Implement the logic to connect and disconnect the wallet.
6. Customize the button's appearance and behavior as desired.

## Usage

Once you've set up the project following the article's instructions, you can use it as follows:

1. Start the development server: `npm start`.

2. Open the DApp in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Click the "Connect Wallet" button to connect your Ethereum wallet.

4. Your wallet address will be displayed on the screen.

5. You can click the button again to disconnect the wallet.
